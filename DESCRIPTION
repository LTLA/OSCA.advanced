Description: 
    Deploys the advanced analysis chapters for the "Orchestrating Single Cell Analysis with Bioconductor" book.
    This describes the more complex steps of a single-cell RNA-seq analysis, ranging from integration of multiple datasets,
    multi-sample differential comparisons, doublet detection, cell cycle assignment, droplet-specific processing,
    nuclei-specific analyses, trajectory analyses, integrated analyses with protein abundances, and interactive visualization.
    It is intended for readers who are already familiar with basic single-cell analyses, possibly after reading some of the prior books in this collection.
