Description: 
    Deploys the advanced analysis chapters for the "Orchestrating Single Cell Analysis with Bioconductor" book.
    This describes the more complex steps of a single-cell RNA-seq analysis, ranging from data integration,
    modality-specific processing, multi-sample analyses, doublet detection, cell cycle assignment and more.
    This builds on many of the concepts introduced in the basic chapters.
